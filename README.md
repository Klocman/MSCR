## MSCR
MSCR is a three-axis DC motor controller for use with robotic arms, for example camera cranes. It can work with any potentiometer-based joystick, and can record and replay movements. This project contains the board layout and firmware. 

## Compiling / Software required
Boards and schematics were created with Eagle PCB v6.6.0. 

Firmare can be opened and compiled with Atmel Studio 6 or newer.
